# Life Expectancy Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Life Expectancy** using a **Linear Regression** machine learning model. The complete implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook as part of a **Data Science Internship**. The project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, saving the model, and making predictions.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset using Pandas
3. Perform data cleaning and handle missing values
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Apply feature selection using VarianceThreshold
6. Split data into training and testing sets
7. Train a Linear Regression model
8. Evaluate model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
9. Save the trained model using Pickle
10. Load the model and predict life expectancy for new data

## 📈 Model Used

**Linear Regression**
Linear Regression was chosen because the target variable (life expectancy) is continuous and numerical.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Lower MSE values indicate better prediction accuracy.

---

## 🔮 Prediction

The trained model successfully predicts life expectancy values when new input data is provided. This confirms that the model has learned meaningful patterns from the dataset.

---

## ✅ Results

* The model produced reasonable predictions
* Important influencing factors include:

  * Adult Mortality
  * Schooling
  * BMI
  * GDP
  * Health Expenditure

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of data preprocessing techniques
* Hands-on experience with regression models
* Practical usage of Scikit-learn
* Experience with real-world health datasets
* Confidence in end-to-end machine learning projects

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Use advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Improve accuracy using feature engineering
* Deploy the model as a web application
